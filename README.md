## Design

### Colour Scheme

color theme of orange, black, and white combines warmth, sophistication, and simplicity to create a visually appealing and engaging aesthetic. The contrast between the boldness of orange and the neutrality of black and white adds visual interest while maintaining readability and clarity.

![Image of color pallete used for the project](foodblog/static/readme-images/color-scheme.png "Colour Scheme")

### Typography

The font used throughout the site is 'Poppins', I have chosen this font because I consider it to be clean and easy to read.

### Layout

The layout of the BiteBurst website is built using the Bootstrap framework, which provides a responsive grid system that allows the website to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. The use of a grid system helps to create a consistent layout on necessary pages of the website, which makes navigation and exploration more intuitive for visitors.

### Accessibility

The site has scored highly in terms of accessibility, I have included alt text descriptions for all images to provide context and information to visually impaired users, Used contrasting colours to enhance accessibility.

### Imagery

Used a combination of imagery from [Foodie](https://www.foodie.com/). The images were chosen to reflect the food theme. Images are all of a similar size and quality for consistency throughout the site.

### Wireframes

[BiteBurst Wireframes](foodblog/static/readme-images/biteburst-wireframes.pdf)

Consistency reigns in my wireframes from inception to completion. I envisioned a dynamic platform comprising a blog-style interface intertwined with an interactive discussion page. Here, users can effortlessly generate, update, peruse, and remove posts, comments, and replies. Additionally, I integrated a feature during sign-up where users indicate their favorite food, adding a personal touch to their profiles. This choice is prominently showcased in the discussion section and can be modified at any juncture, ensuring a tailored and engaging user experience.

### Database Relationships Schema

![alt text](foodblog/static/readme-images/database-schema-1.png)
![alt text](foodblog/static/readme-images/database-schema.png)

**User to Posts**

- One to Many.
- Each user can have multiple posts.
- The user object will have a `posts` property to query all related posts. This allows users to create and manage their own posts.

**Post to User**

- Many to One.
- Each post belongs to one user.
- The post object will have a `user` property to query the related user object. This associates each post with its author.

**Post to Comment**

- One to Many.
- Each post can have multiple comments.
- The post object will have a `comments` property to access all comments related to it.

**Comment to Post**

- Many to One.
- Each comment belongs to one post.
- The comment object will have a `post` property to access the post it belongs to. This allows comments to be associated with specific posts.

**User to Comments**

- One to Many.
- Each user can make many comments.
- The user object will have a `comments` property to fetch all comments authored by that user.

**Comment to User**

- Many to One.
- Each comment is authored by one user.
- The comment object will have a `user` property to access the user who authored it. This links comments to their respective authors.

### Security

A number of different security considerations were taken into account when putting together this project.

**Use of .env file**

Vital credentials, such as DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY, are stored in a .env file, which is listed in the .gitignore file to maintain its confidentiality. Initially, the SECRET_KEY was stored in the init.py file but has been relocated to the more secure .env file. Additionally, the database was destroyed and reconstructed to generate a new DATABASE_URL.

**Defensive Programming**

The website incorporates various safeguards to restrict unauthorized actions by users. For instance, accessing individual BiteBurst pages or adding a post is restricted to signed-up users only. These restrictions are enforced using the @login_required decorators.

**Password Hashing**

bcrypt: In Flask applications, bcrypt is a widely used library for securely hashing passwords. Password hashing is a crucial aspect of user authentication, as it ensures that passwords are stored securely in the database. Bcrypt employs a strong cryptographic hashing algorithm that incorporates salting and key stretching to protect against various forms of attacks, including brute-force and rainbow table attacks. Salting involves adding random data to each password before hashing, while key stretching involves applying the hashing algorithm multiple times to slow down the hashing process, making it more resilient against password cracking attempts. By utilizing bcrypt, Flask applications can enhance the security of user authentication and safeguard user passwords against unauthorized access.

**Input Validation**

The provided code implements several measures to ensure the integrity and security of user registrations. Firstly, it verifies whether the email already exists in the database to prevent duplicate registrations. Additionally, it enforces validation checks on the length of the email, username, and password to ensure users provide sufficiently complex information. Furthermore, the registration process includes a password confirmation step, where users are required to enter their password twice for verification. In case of mismatch, an error message is displayed to prompt users to rectify the inconsistency.

**Feedback to Users**

Flash messages serve to communicate the outcome of user actions, providing feedback such as successful login or reasons for authentication failure. However, these messages are crafted to maintain a balance between informing users and preserving security. Instead of overly specific errors like "incorrect password for given email," the messages are more generalized, stating 'Email does not exist' or 'Incorrect password, try again.' This approach ensures clarity for users while safeguarding sensitive information.

## Features

### General features

**Sign up**  

Users have the ability to sign up, and must choose their favourite food.

![Image of sign-up page](foodblog/static/readme-images/sign-up.png "Optional title")

**Logout**  
Once users are finished on the site, they can click click the sign out button which will take them to the home page.

**Footer**  
Users can navigate to respective social media sites that are present in the footer.

![Footer](foodblog/static/readme-images/footer.png)

**Flash Messages**  
I chose to use flash messages as a positive feedback to users whenever they made an action on the site. Everything from logging in, to adding a post to try something they aren't authorised to do.

![Flash image](foodblog/static/readme-images/flash.png)

**Creative timestamping**  
I decided to included a date and time that informed users when the post was created and what time it was posted. I think this makes it easier to remember when the post was created.

![Time Stamp](foodblog/static/readme-images/timestamp.png)
