## User Experience (UX)  

### User Stories

**User Story 1**

## Design  

### Colour Scheme

color theme of orange, black, and white combines warmth, sophistication, and simplicity to create a visually appealing and engaging aesthetic. The contrast between the boldness of orange and the neutrality of black and white adds visual interest while maintaining readability and clarity.

![Image of color pallete used for the project](foodblog/static/readme-images/color-scheme.png "Colour Scheme")

### Typography

The font used throughout the site is 'Poppins', I have chosen this font because I consider it to be clean and easy to read.  


### Layout

The layout of the BiteBurst website is built using the Bootstrap framework, which provides a responsive grid system that allows the website to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. The use of a grid system helps to create a consistent layout on necessary pages of the website, which makes navigation and exploration more intuitive for visitors.  



### Accessibility  

The site has scored highly in terms of accessibility, I have included alt text descriptions for all images to provide context and information to visually impaired users, Used contrasting colours to enhance accessibility.  


### Imagery  
Used a combination of imagery from Pixabay (See media below) and an image that i had taken myself. Images are all of a similar size and quality for consistency throughout the site.  


### Wireframes

### Data Model  


# Database Relationships Schema

**User to Posts**
- One to Many.
- Each user can have multiple posts.
- The user object will have a `posts` property to query all related posts. This allows users to create and manage their own posts.

**Post to User**
- Many to One.
- Each post belongs to one user.
- The post object will have a `user` property to query the related user object. This associates each post with its author.

**Post to Comment**
- One to Many.
- Each post can have multiple comments.
- The post object will have a `comments` property to access all comments related to it.

**Comment to Post**
- Many to One.
- Each comment belongs to one post.
- The comment object will have a `post` property to access the post it belongs to. This allows comments to be associated with specific posts.

**User to Comments**
- One to Many.
- Each user can make many comments.
- The user object will have a `comments` property to fetch all comments authored by that user.

**Comment to User**
- Many to One.
- Each comment is authored by one user.
- The comment object will have a `user` property to access the user who authored it. This links comments to their respective authors.


### Security  

A number of different security considerations were taken into account when putting together this project.  

**Use of .env file**  
Important credentials including DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY are located within .env file which is subsequently in a .gitignore file to ensure it remains secure. SECRET_KEY was initially located in __init__.py file, it has since been changed and moved to a more secure location in .env file, the database was also subsequently destroyed and rebuilt to produce a different DATABASE_URL.  

**Defensive Programming**  
Measures have been put in place throughout the site to prevent users from doing things they are not authorised to do. For example, A user who has not signed up to the site, cannot access any of the individual BiteBurst pages or unable to add a post. This has been implemented using @login_required decorators.  

**Password Hashing**  
 

**Input Validation**  
The code checks if the email already exists in the database to prevent duplicate registrations. Validation checks on the length of the email, username, and password ensure that users provide sufficiently complex information. Passwords entered during the registration process are confirmed by having the user enter them twice. If they don't match, an error is shown.  

**Feedback to Users**  
Flash messages provide feedback to users about the status of their actions. For example, 'successful login or reasons for authentication failure'. However, care is taken not to provide overly specific errors. For example, rather than saying "incorrect password for given email," the feedback messages are generalised like 'Email does not exist' or 'Incorrect password, try again.'  


## Features

### General features  
**Sign up**  
Users have the ability to sign up, and must choose their favourite food.

![Image of sign-up page](README-images/ "Optional title")

**Log in**  
Users can login using the information that they provided at the sign up process.  

![Image of login page](README-images/ "Optional title")

**Home page**  
Users are presented with an overview page that includes interactive images of 12 Food card receipes that the site currently facilitates (Fish Receipes, Chicken Receipes, Chinese Receipes, Taco Receipes, Sweet Treat Receipes, Baking Receipes, Meat Receipes, Pasta Receipes). When users hover over the images, they scale up slightly causing the image to be zoom out a little, leading to a better user experience.

**Meals page**  
Individual page where users can go through and look at pictures of meals to create and inspire.

**Receipes page**  
Individual page where users can select any of the cards, which will then show them a receipe with instructions on how to make it.

**Discussion**  
Individual page where users can go to post and interact with other users about Food.  

**Post feature**  
Users can post content onto the discussion page, they can also browse other posts that users have already posted. The most recent posts will populate at the top of the page so that users are immediately displayed with the most recent posts.  

![Image of post feature](README-images/ "Optional title")

**Comment feature**  
Users can comment on posts made by themselves or other users, comments can be deleted once they have been added. The most recent comments are populated towards the bottom of the comments section, this way users can browse the older comments towards the top and the most recent responses towards the bottom.  

![Image of comment feature](README-images/ "Optional title")

**Delete modal**  
Users can delete posts and comments once they have added them. A confirmation 'delete modal' is displayed once the user clicks the 'delete' button.  

![Image of delete modal](README-images/ "Optional title")

**My profile**  
Users can navigate to the 'My profile' page, here they can add to their bio, change their favourite food that is displayed on their profile page. This can be viewed in any posts/comment.

![Image profile page](README-images/ "Optional title")


**Logout**  
Once users are finished on the site, they can click click the logout button which will take them to the home page.  

**Footer**  
Users can navigate to respective social media sites that are present in the footer.

![Image of footer](README-images/ "Optional title")  

**Flash Messages**  
I chose to use flash messages as a positive feedback to users whenever they made an action on the site. Everything from logging in, to adding a post to try something they aren't authorised to do.  

![Image of flash message](README-images/ "Optional title")  

**Creative timestamping**  
I decided to included a date and time that informed users when the post was posted. I think this makes it easier to remember when the post was created.

![Image of timestamp](README-images/ "Optional title")


### Future Implementations
There are a number of different features that could be implemented in the future;  
- Private messaging function that allows users to message directly.
- More interactive profiles that allow users to upload images and other content.
- The ability to view other users profiles.
