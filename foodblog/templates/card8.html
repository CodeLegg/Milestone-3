                <p>
                    Elevate your dining experience with our delectable Honey Baked Ham! This culinary masterpiece is a
                    symphony of flavors, promising a perfect blend of sweetness and savory notes. A feast for both the
                    eyes and the taste buds, this honey-glazed ham is a showstopper that will take center stage at your
                    festive gatherings, creating memorable moments for everyone around the table.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Crafting the perfect Honey Baked Ham involves a careful selection of premium ingredients, much like
                    the attention to detail required for Gooey Chocolate Cookies. Each element contributes to the
                    overall harmony of taste, from the succulent ham itself to the luscious honey glaze that envelops
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The enchantment begins with the choice of high-quality ham, ensuring a tender and flavorful
                    centerpiece for your celebration. Just as chocolate is the star in Gooey Chocolate Cookies, the ham
                    takes center stage in this culinary creation, and the quality of the meat is essential for a truly
                    exceptional dish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Glazing the Honey Baked Ham is a delightful process, allowing for a playfulness reminiscent of
                    decorating Gooey Chocolate Cookies. The honey glaze, with its perfect balance of sweetness, adds a
                    glossy finish that not only enhances the flavor but also creates an enticing caramelization on the
                    exterior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similar to the patience required for letting Gooey Chocolate Cookies set, achieving the perfect
                    texture and flavor in a Honey Baked Ham involves slow roasting and basting. The result is a ham that
                    is juicy on the inside, with a delectable crust that beckons with each slice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final touch, akin to the presentation of any culinary masterpiece, is the finishing flourish.
                    Whether it's a garnish of fresh herbs, a drizzle of honey, or an artful arrangement of fruits, these
                    details elevate your Honey Baked Ham into a feast for both the palate and the eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, as you embark on this Honey Baked Ham culinary adventure, relish in the process, honor the
                    ingredients, and create a delightful centerpiece that not only graces your festive table but becomes
                    a cherished tradition in your holiday celebrations. As you savor the richness of your creation, let
                    your Honey Baked Ham be a celebration of the timeless joy of gathering, bringing warmth and flavor
                    to your home and leaving a lasting imprint on your culinary legacy.

                    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cloves</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Preheat the Oven:</h4>
                        <p>Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C).</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Prepare the Ham:</h4>
                        <p>Place the spiral-sliced ham in a roasting pan, cut side down.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Mix the Glaze:</h4>
                        <p>In a saucepan, combine honey, Dijon mustard, brown sugar, orange juice, whole grain mustard,
                            ground cinnamon,
                            ground cloves, and ground nutmeg. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the
                            mixture is well
                            combined and slightly thickened.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Glaze the Ham:</h4>
                        <p>Brush a generous amount of the glaze over the entire surface of the ham, ensuring it gets
                            into the slices.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Bake:</h4>
                        <p>Cover the ham with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hour, occasionally basting
                            with the
                            glaze. Remove the foil for the last 15-20 minutes to allow the ham to caramelize.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Check Internal Temperature:</h4>
                        <p>Ensure the ham reaches an internal temperature of 140°F (60°C). If needed, adjust the baking
                            time
                            accordingly.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Rest and Serve:</h4>
                        <p>Allow the ham to rest for 10-15 minutes before carving. Serve slices with the remaining glaze
                            on the side.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    <h4 class="fst-italic">Cooking Tip:</h4>
                    <p>For an extra layer of flavor and moisture, consider scoring the surface of the ham in a
                        crisscross pattern before applying the glaze. This not only enhances the presentation by
                        creating an appealing diamond pattern but also allows the glaze to penetrate deeper, infusing
                        the ham with a perfect balance of sweetness and savory goodness. Additionally, baste the ham
                        with the pan juices throughout the cooking process to ensure a succulent and flavorful outcome.
                        Enjoy the delightful combination of a caramelized exterior and juicy interior for a memorable
                        Honey Baked Ham experience!
